# Invertion-Shader

This is actually my very first shader! I wanted to make for a project of mine, dont know much about coding, had to learn a lot to do it, but as far as i knew i've made this shader effect and hope this will help people make cool effects too :)))

In summary, it inverts the colors or the texture you're using on your object! Its an Unlit Simple shader, it has RGBA and Texture imput. I tried to put a Cutout and Opaque rendering on it, but for the invert color effect to work, it has to be transparent. Also make sure the Transparent Render Queue is set above like the image, so that the rendering gets the closer objects on the view.
